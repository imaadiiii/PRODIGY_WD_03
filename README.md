## Description

This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to play against each other, taking turns to mark the cells on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all cells are marked and no player has three in a row, the game is declared a draw. The game status (winner, draw, or current player's turn) is displayed near the reset button.
